Problem Statement: 4.7

Blood glucose levels for obese patients have a mean of 100 with a standard deviation of
15. A researcher thinks that a diet high in raw cornstarch will have a positive effect on
blood glucose levels. A sample of 36 patients who have tried the raw cornstarch diet
have a mean glucose level of 108. Test the hypothesis that the raw cornstarch had an
effect or not.

Solution:

Steps are as follows:-

Step-1: State the hypotheses. The population mean is 100.

Null Hypothesis - H0:mu = 100
Alternate Hypothesis - H1:mu > 100

Step-2: Set up the significance level. It is not given in the problem so let’s assume it as 5% (0.05).

Step-3: Compute the random chance probability using z score and z-table.


For this set of data: z= (108-100) / (15/√36)=3.20

You can look at the probability by looking at z- table and p-value associated with 3.20 is 0.9993 

i.e. probability of having value less than 108 is 0.9993
`````More than or equals to 108 is (1-0.9993)=0.0007.

Step-4: It is less than 0.05 so we will reject the Null hypothesis 
            Which means, there is raw cornstarch effect.
